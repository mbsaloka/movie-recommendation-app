### **Final Project – Knowledge-Based System Engineering (RSBP F)**

---

## Project Overview
**MovieGraphRec** is a graph-based movie recommendation system built using the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset** and **Neo4j Graph Database**.
The system generates movie recommendations based on **shared genres, keywords, and actors** using graph relationship traversal.

---

## Project Objectives
- Utilize the **TMDB 5000 Movie Metadata** public dataset from Kaggle.
- Perform **data preprocessing** and transform the data into a graph structure.
- Build a **graph database (Neo4j)** with the following nodes:
  - `Movie`
  - `Genre`
  - `Actor`
  - `Keyword`
- Define relationships:
  - `(:Movie)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(:Genre)`
  - `(:Movie)-[:HAS_KEYWORD]->(:Keyword)`
  - `(:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)`
- Implement a **graph-based recommendation algorithm** that finds movies with the highest number of shared attributes.

---

## Recommendation Concept
Movie recommendations are generated by:
- Traversing connected nodes in the graph.
- Measuring similarity based on:
  - Shared **genres**
  - Shared **keywords**
  - Shared **actors**
- Ranking movies by the **number of shared relationships**.
